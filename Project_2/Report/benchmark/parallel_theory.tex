Parallaizing codes can be very beneficial. It can take in use the entire workforce
of a computer, or it can occupy a whole super cluster working towards the same goal.
The parallalization of the kind needed for this project is fairly easy, there is no
communication between processes during the run, and writing to files can be done
seperatly. There is also vectorization of the code that can be seen as an 
internal parallazation due to making use of the whole register by ordering operations
in a parallel order. The vectorization that is implemented in this project are 
only done by adding compiler flags.
The change needed to the code to parallize this problem can consist of only two MPI functions.
